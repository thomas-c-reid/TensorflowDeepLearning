# Tensorflow Basics

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and examples related to learning the basics of Tensorflow. The main focus is on understanding the tensorflow library by completing exercises, making notes and playing about with the concept of neural networks

TF Projects:

1. Simple Digit classifier using tensorflow dense Layers
2. Importing data into google colab
3. Sentiment analysis of movie reviews, with a focus on Embedding layers
4. Using Sonar Dataset to predict whether object is rock or metal. But using dropout layers to combat overfitting  
5. Autoencoders - using an autoencoder on mnist dataset to compress and upscale images
6. Convolutional autoencoder - running convolutional neural network to predict images from mnist dataset
7. denoising autoencoder - convolutional neural network trained to reduce noise on mnist dataset  
8. Simple Linear Regression - using Tensorflow library to preform linear regression on dataset
9. KNN tensorflow - building a KNN classification model using tensorflow 
10. introduction to Time series forecasting - extracting trend data from airline passengers dataset
11. ARIMA Time series forecasting - building an arima model with auto_arima to predict airline passenger trends over time
12. Feed forward time series forecasting - building a simple Dense network to predict airline passenger trends over time
13. Time Series forecasting using LSTM - an introduction to LSTM using it to predict airline passenger trends over time

TF Notes:

- Tensorflow CNN Layers - Learning about the usage behind each of the layer types and what parameters they can use  
- TF Layers Arguement Options - Learning about parameters that have different options. E.g. activation functions  
- NN Architechture - Learning about the different architectures behind common deep learning practices
