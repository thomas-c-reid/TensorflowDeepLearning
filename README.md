# Tensorflow Basics

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and examples related to learning the basics of Tensorflow. The main focus is on understanding the tensorflow library by completing exercises, making notes and playing about with the concept of neural networks

1. Simple Digit classifier using tensorflow dense Layers
2. Importing data into google colab
3. Sentiment analysis of movie reviews, with a focus on Embedding layers

TF Notes:
Tensorflow CNN Layers - Learning about the usage behind each of the layer types and what parameters they can use
TF Layers Arguement Options - Learning about parameters that have different options. E.g. activation functions
