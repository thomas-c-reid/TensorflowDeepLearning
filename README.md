# Tensorflow Basics

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and examples related to learning the basics of Tensorflow. The main focus is on understanding the tensorflow library by completing exercises, making notes and playing about with the concept of neural networks

TF Projects:

1. Simple Digit classifier using tensorflow dense Layers
2. Importing data into google colab
3. Sentiment analysis of movie reviews, with a focus on Embedding layers
4. Using Sonar Dataset to predict whether object is rock or metal. But using dropout layers to combat overfitting  
5. Autoencoders - using an autoencoder to denoise an mnist dataset
6. Convolutional autoencoder - running convolutional neural network to predict images from mnist dataset

TF Notes:

- Tensorflow CNN Layers - Learning about the usage behind each of the layer types and what parameters they can use  
- TF Layers Arguement Options - Learning about parameters that have different options. E.g. activation functions  
- NN Architechture - Learning about the different architectures behind common deep learning practices
